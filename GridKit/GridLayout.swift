    /// - note: A great way to take advantage of this layout is to extend `GridLayout` with static properties matching your different use cases. The demo included with this framework provides 3 static properties for layouts resembling the App Store, Netflix, and HBONow apps. While these are included for demo purposes, respect the work and don't copy.
