# Getting Started

Making apps with scrolling rows and section headers is a common UI pattern. GridKit makes it easy to pull off common use cases similar to the App Store's featured Apps screen, or Netflix's list of rows and scrolling poster frames.

# Installation
## Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install carthage

To integrate GridKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

github "need2edit/GridKit" ~> 1.0
Run carthage update to build the framework and drag the built GridKit.framework into your Xcode project.

# Demo Project

The demo project in this repo includes two layout examples resembling the App Store and Netflix.
