# Getting Started

Making apps with scrolling rows and section headers is a common UI pattern. GridKit makes it easy to pull off common use cases similar to the App Store's featured Apps screen, or Netflix's list of rows and scrolling poster frames.

# Documentation

Check out [GridKit's documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/need2edit/GridKit/blob/master/docs/index.html) courtesy of [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy).

# Installation
## Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install carthage

To integrate GridKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:
	github "need2edit/GridKit" ~> 1.0
Run carthage update to build the framework and drag the built GridKit.framework into your Xcode project.

# Demo Project

The demo project in this repo includes two layout examples resembling the App Store and Netflix.
